    <p>
        The Key Spouse Program is a support network designed to enhance the well-being of military families. Volunteers (Key Spouses) act as a bridge between leadership and families, offering resources, information, and a listening ear. They help build community connections, support families during deployments, and offer guidance during transitions. The program fosters resilience by promoting communication and providing critical information to spouses and families, ensuring they feel supported throughout their military journey.</p>
